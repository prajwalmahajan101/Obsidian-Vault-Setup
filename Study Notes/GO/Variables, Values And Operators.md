```go
package main

import "fmt"
import "math"

func main() {
	var investmentAmount = 1000
	var expectedReturnRate = 5.5
	var years float64 = 10

	var futureValue = float64(investmentAmount) * math.Pow(1 + expectedReturnRate/100, years)

	fmt.Print("Future value: ", futureValue)
	//  1708.1444583535929
}


```

- Go is statically typed Language
- To create a variable we can use `var`  keyword 
```go 
var variable_name = value
var varoable_name variable_type = value
var varible_anem variable_type
```

- To convert the type from one to other we can use typecasting
```go
var investmentAmount int = 1000
var investmentAmountFloat float64 = float64(investmentAmount)
```
## Basic Types

- ***int*** - A number WITHOUT decimal places (e.g., -5, 10, 12 etc)
- ***float64*** - A number WITH decimal places (e.g., -5.2, 10.123, 12.9 etc)
- ***string*** - A text value (created via double quotes or backticks: "Hello World", \`Hi everyone\')
- ***bool*** - true or false

## Basic But Not Generally Used Types

- ***uint*** -  An unsigned integer which means a strictly non-negative integer (e.g., 0, 10, 255 etc)
- ***int32*** - A 32-bit signed integer, which is an integer with a specific range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (e.g., -1234567890, 1234567890)
- ***rune*** - An alias for int32, represents a Unicode code point (i.e., a single character), and is used when dealing with Unicode characters (e.g., 'a', 'Ã±', 'ä¸–')
- ***uint32*** - A 32-bit unsigned integer, an integer that can represent values from 0 to 4,294,967,295
- ***int64*** - A 64-bit signed integer, an integer that can represent a larger range of values, specifically from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- ***There also are more types like `int8` or `uint8` which work in the same way (=> integer with smaller number range)***
## Null Values

All Go value types come with a so-called "null value" which is the value stored in a variable if no other value is explicitly set.

For example, the following int variable would have a default value of 0 (because 0 is the null value of int, int32 etc):

```go
var age int // age is 0
```

- int --> 0
- float64 --> 0.0
- string --> ""
- bool --> false
